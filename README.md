The task we will be asking our robot to perform is restocking grocery shelves. The robot will check each of the cells on a shelf to determine which ones require a product. Furthermore, depending on which cell is empty, the robot will be able to determine which product belongs on that shelf, retrieve it from the crate, and place it in the appropriate spot. This is demonstrated by the diagram below.
